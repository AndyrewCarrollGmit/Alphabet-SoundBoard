# Alphabet-SoundBoard by Andrew Carroll


<h3> Mobile Applications Project </h3>

<p> For Mobile Applications module we were asked to create a universal windows project that included one of the following features: </p>
1. Accelerometer or Gyroscope <br> 
2. GPS (Location Based Services) <br>
3. Sound <br>
4. Network Services (connecting to server for data updates etc) <br>
5. Camera <br>
6. Multi Touch Gesture Management 

<h4> What is the application? </h4>
<p> I chose to create my application around the feature <b> Sound </b>, I did some research and came to the conclusion that a soundboard would be the design of my project as it didnt seem overally difficult for my level of programming. When searching different types of soundboards that have been created before alot seemed to be based around tv shows and movies, so I decided to base mine on education and towards infants starting to learn the alphabet. </p>

<h4> How it works? </h4>
<p> I tried to keep the functionality and structure of the project as simple as possible because it was aimed at a very young age group. The Application is very simple  to use, when the user presses a button on the screen it will play the sound and pronounce the letter back to the user all the way from A-Z when each letter is pressed. This is a nice easy way to help young infants become familiar with the alphabet and start to learn each letter. I also added a button on the bottom of the application that reads " Play Me " after the button is pressed it will begin to play the nursery rhyme the "ABC" song.. a simple feature which will help kids to start to remember the letters of the alphabet even further.   </p>
